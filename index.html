  <tr><td class="body fact">ibuprofen (aka nurofen, advil, etc) belongs to a class of drug called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. their <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4355401/">main method of action</a> is to inhibit the creation of inflammatory agents, which means they are generally ineffective against pain that isn't a result of inflammation.
  <br>conversely, paracetamol (panadol, tylenol etc) seems to act mostly by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15662292/">meddling with the brain's chemical receptors</a> <a href="https://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/aches-pains/a26339/paracetamol-uses-and-action/">[2]</a> in order to kick the natural pain regulation system into overdrive and decrease the upwards action of the body's thermal system.
  <br>you should avoid using ibuprofen for pain when the inflammation is important to the healing or damage mitigation process, such as a cut, and you should avoid using paracetamol for pain when you have a fever due to viral infection because viruses don't like high temperatures.
  <br>in short: it's important to understand your physiology and what medications are doing!</td></tr>
