# goals
to create an engaging, interesting, unique list of facts
# rules
facts must be
- notable
- unique
- verifiable
- interesting
- legitimate (ie not just number-stuffing, like 'did you know bananas are yellow?')
- family friendly
# additional
facts should be legitimately discovered, and not actively sought out - if i did that, i would just be a content farm/aggregator, and i hate that.
eipFacts should comply at all times with the [eipNet privacy policy](https://eiphax.tech/privacy)
